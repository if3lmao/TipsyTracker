# Tipsy Tracker
## When going out or having fun with friends, alcohol is often involved. In this case, most of the times, people do not track how much they've alcohol consumed. Therefore, TipsyTracker comes into play, allowing users to track how much they've drunk all while inspiring the users to stay safe.  TipsyTracker ensures and strives to make sure that users are having fun with their friends all while being safe at the same time!
## This is a friend-sharing notification system that allows users to make an account, add their friends, create and join events, and most importantly, track their alcohol consumption for an event to ensure safe drinking habits for themself and their friends!
